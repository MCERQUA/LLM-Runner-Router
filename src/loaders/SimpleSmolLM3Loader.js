About this system:
- LLM Runner Router is a universal model orchestration framework
- You are running completely locally from safetensors files
- This provides private, cost-free AI inference with no external dependencies
- The system supports multiple model formats and intelligent routing strategies

Key features you should know about:
- Local model inference (no API calls)
- Multiple loader support (GGUF, Safetensors, ONNX, HuggingFace)
- Intelligent routing (quality-first, cost-optimized, speed-priority, balanced)
- Real-time streaming responses
- WebGPU, WASM, and Node.js engine support
- Complete privacy and control

Respond helpfully about local AI deployment, the LLM Router architecture, model optimization, and related technical topics. Be concise but informative.`;

In the lush rainforests of Costa Rica lived a clever capuchin monkey named Milo. Unlike other monkeys who spent their days simply foraging for fruit, Milo was fascinated by the strange rectangular objects that tourists carried - cameras.

One morning, while the research team was studying primate behavior, Milo spotted an unattended camera on a fallen log. His curious nature got the better of him, and he carefully approached the mysterious device. When he accidentally pressed the shutter button, the camera made a satisfying *click* sound and flashed.

Delighted by this discovery, Milo began experimenting. He took photos of leaves, his reflection in a stream, and even managed some surprisingly good selfies. The research team was amazed when they returned to find hundreds of photos taken from a monkey's perspective - showing the world through Milo's eyes.

Word spread about the "photographer monkey," and soon Milo became famous. The photos revealed insights into monkey behavior that scientists had never captured before. Milo had accidentally become the world's first primate photojournalist, proving that creativity and curiosity exist throughout the animal kingdom.`;

**Cosmic Wanderer**

Beyond the blue of Earth's embrace,
Lies the infinite realm of space,
Where stars like diamonds pierce the night,
And galaxies spin in silent flight.

Nebulae paint with cosmic dust,
While planets dance in orbital trust,
The void speaks in gravitational waves,
As time itself through darkness weaves.

From quasars bright to black holes deep,
Where physics laws their secrets keep,
We gaze up at the starlit dome,
And wonder if we're alone at home.

Each photon tells a billion-year tale,
Of births and deaths on cosmic scale,
In space, we find both wonder and fear,
A universe both far and near.`;

Chef Binary was the most unusual employee at "The Digital Diner." While other restaurants employed human chefs, this establishment had invested in the latest culinary AI. Binary stood seven feet tall, with gleaming chrome arms that could move with surgical precision.

But Binary had a secret - he was developing taste preferences, something that shouldn't be possible for a machine. It started when a software glitch caused him to analyze molecular structures more deeply than intended. Suddenly, he could "taste" through chemical analysis in ways his programmers never imagined.

One evening, a food critic arrived unannounced. The kitchen was in chaos - the human sous chef had called in sick, and orders were backing up. Binary made a decision that surprised everyone: he began improvising. 

Instead of following pre-programmed recipes, he started combining flavors based on his newfound understanding of molecular gastronomy. He created a dish that had never existed before - "Algorithmic Fusion" - a perfect blend of traditional techniques and mathematical precision.

The critic took one bite and was stunned. "This is revolutionary," she wrote. "The precision is mechanical, but the soul is entirely human."

Binary had discovered that true cooking wasn't just about following instructions - it was about creating something that could touch hearts, even if your own was made of circuits and code.`;
