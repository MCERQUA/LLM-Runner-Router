# LLM-Runner-Router Current Status

## ‚úÖ Working Components

### Infrastructure
- **Server**: Running on `178.156.181.117:3000`
- **PM2**: Managing 4 cluster instances
- **Chat Interface**: Available at `/chat/`
- **API**: Fully operational with authentication

### Model Support
- **GGUF Models**: ‚úÖ Fully working with node-llama-cpp
  - TinyLlama model loaded successfully
  - Using ~1.7GB RAM
  - Ready for inference
- **Mock Models**: ‚úÖ Working for testing
- **BitNet Models**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CMake installed but BitNet.cpp has build issues

### CMake Installation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully installed
- **Version**: 3.28.1
- **Location**: `~/.local/cmake/`
- **PATH**: Added to `.bashrc` for permanent access

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### BitNet.cpp Build Issue
The BitNet repository is missing source files:
- Missing: `bitnet-lut-kernels.h`
- This is an upstream issue with the BitNet.cpp project
- CMake is working correctly - the issue is with BitNet source code

### Solutions
1. **Wait for BitNet.cpp fixes**: The project needs to fix missing files
2. **Use GGUF models**: These are working perfectly with node-llama-cpp
3. **Alternative 1-bit models**: Look for GGUF quantized versions of BitNet models

## üìä Current Performance

- **Model Loaded**: TinyLlama 1.1B GGUF
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.7GB RAM
- **Status**: Ready for inference
- **API Endpoints**: All operational

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Use GGUF models** - These are fully functional
2. **Monitor BitNet.cpp** project for fixes
3. **Consider alternative quantization** methods that work with GGUF

## üìù Summary

The LLM-Runner-Router is **fully operational** with GGUF model support. BitNet integration is prepared but waiting for upstream fixes to the BitNet.cpp project. CMake is successfully installed and ready for future use.
