# LLM-Runner-Router Project Cleanup Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive cleanup plan to resolve duplicate assets, orphaned scripts, and ensure the LLM-Runner-Router project is production-ready.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Distributed Assets
**Problem**: Both `dist/` and `public/` contain the same static documentation and example files, causing confusion about which directory is authoritative.

**Analysis**:
- `public/` is the source directory containing original files
- `dist/` is the build output directory created by `scripts/build.js`
- Build process: `scripts/build.js` copies `public/` → `dist/`
- Netlify configuration: `publish = "dist"` in `netlify.toml`
- NPM packaging: `dist/` excluded from package via `package.json` files array

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - This is correct architecture
- `public/` = source files for web documentation
- `dist/` = build output for Netlify deployment
- No duplication issue - this is intended build process

### 2. Orphaned benchmark-summary.js
**Problem**: `benchmark-summary.js` exists at repo root but is never referenced elsewhere.

**Analysis**:
- File location: `/scripts/development/benchmark-summary.js` 
- Content: Quick benchmark script for LLM Router performance testing
- References: Found in cleanup reports, not integrated into main workflows
- Git status: Already marked for deletion

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR REMOVAL** - File already marked for deletion in git

### 3. Unused check-rate-limiter.js
**Problem**: `check-rate-limiter.js` present but not invoked anywhere in codebase.

**Analysis**:
- File location: `/scripts/development/check-rate-limiter.js`
- Content: Simple rate-limiter-flexible package testing script
- Purpose: Development testing of rate limiter exports
- Git status: Already marked for deletion

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR REMOVAL** - File already marked for deletion in git

## Cleanup Actions Required

### Phase 1: Validate Current State ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze project structure and identify all duplicate assets
- [x] Review dist/ vs public/ directories and determine authoritative source
- [x] Evaluate benchmark-summary.js for integration or removal
- [x] Handle unused check-rate-limiter.js script

### Phase 2: Documentation System Validation
- [ ] Confirm web docs system integrity (docs/ vs public/docs/ vs dist/docs/)
- [ ] Verify JSDoc generation creates proper API documentation
- [ ] Test documentation deployment pipeline

### Phase 3: Build System Validation
- [ ] Test build process: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify Netlify deployment configuration
- [ ] Confirm package.json files array excludes dist/ appropriately
- [ ] Test documentation generation: `npm run docs`

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Test development workflow: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify API provider adapters functionality
- [ ] Test model loading and inference capabilities

### Phase 5: Final Cleanup
- [ ] Commit pending deletions (orphaned scripts already marked)
- [ ] Update package.json if needed (scripts, dependencies)
- [ ] Generate fresh documentation
- [ ] Create deployment verification checklist

## Documentation System Architecture

### Three-Layer Documentation System
1. **Source Docs** (`docs/`) - Markdown documentation source
2. **Public Docs** (`public/docs/`) - Web-ready documentation for browser access
3. **Generated API Docs** (`docs/api/`) - JSDoc generated HTML documentation

### Build Process Flow
```
Source Code → JSDoc → docs/api/*.html
docs/*.md → Processed → public/docs/*.md  
public/* → Build Script → dist/*
dist/* → Netlify → Production Website
```

## Critical Files Status

### Keep (No Changes Needed)
- `public/` directory - Source for web assets
- `dist/` directory - Build output (Netlify publish target)
- `scripts/build.js` - Build process (copies public → dist)
- `netlify.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `package.json` files array - Correctly excludes dist/

### Remove (Already Marked for Deletion)
- `scripts/development/benchmark-summary.js` ✅ 
- `scripts/development/check-rate-limiter.js` ✅
- Various other cleanup files marked in git status

## Validation Checklist

### Build System Health
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] `dist/` directory populated correctly
- [ ] Documentation assets copied properly
- [ ] No broken references in build output

### Documentation System Health  
- [ ] JSDoc generation works: `npm run docs`
- [ ] Web docs accessible in browser
- [ ] API documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] All internal links functional

### Development Workflow Health
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts development server
- [ ] Live reload functionality works
- [ ] Test suite passes: `npm test`
- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`

### Deployment Health
- [ ] Netlify build simulation successful
- [ ] All redirects configured properly
- [ ] Security headers applied
- [ ] Content delivery optimized

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 2-5** systematically
2. **Test each component** thoroughly after cleanup
3. **Document any issues** encountered during validation
4. **Create production deployment checklist**
5. **Verify project is fully production-ready**

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: 
- Orphaned script removal (already marked for deletion)
- Documentation validation (non-destructive testing)

**Medium Risk**:
- Build system changes (test thoroughly before committing)
- Package.json modifications (verify dependencies)

**High Risk**: 
- None identified - cleanup is primarily validation and removal of unused files

## Success Criteria

✅ **Project Ready for Production When**:
1. All tests pass (`npm test`)
2. Build completes without errors (`npm run build`)
3. Documentation generates correctly (`npm run docs`)
4. Development workflow functions (`npm run dev`)
5. No orphaned or unused files remain
6. Netlify deployment simulated successfully
7. Documentation systems verified functional
8. All git changes committed and project clean
